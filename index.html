            <p class="third-screen-cat">It's been an entire month and things are going...not great. Your cat sleeps all day and eats all your food and occasionally poops on your desk. On somedays you regret adopting him as he spends his time tormenting you when you are home. This was the wrong choice. </p>

            <p>It's been an entire month and things are going phenomenal with your new dog. Your dog can do every trick in the book and somehow learned how to speak. Hes your bestfriend and would do anything for you and can even bring you stuff in your house when you dont wanna leave your room. You made the best choice. </p>
